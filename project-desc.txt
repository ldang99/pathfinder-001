- A square matrix (n X n) polulated with integer numbers.
- A sequence satisfies the following things:
	+ It connects some elements of the matrix.
	+ The number of the elements in the sequence equals to the number of row of the matrix.
	+ It starts from the element [1, 1] of the matrix.
	+ The element [k] of the sequence is in the row [k] of the matrix.
	+ The element [k] of the sequence with k > 1 and k < n is in the same column or in the next column with the element [k - 1].
- The score of a sequence is the product of all its elements.

Find a sequence with the highest score.
